## Architecture

Each `year` should match this convention:

```
[year]/
â”œâ”€â”€ [day]
â””â”€â”€ template/
    â”œâ”€â”€ part-one.[ext]
    â””â”€â”€ part-two.[ext]
```

Note that `year` and `day` should be a numeric folder without leading zeroes, eg.: `2024`/`25`

## Generate

Use the `generate.sh` script to create a new day from template, the script asks the `year`
and the `day` thats by default is the current year and the highest solved puzzle to that year
plus one

```sh
./generate.sh
```

To run straightly with the default pass the argument `y`

```sh
./generate.sh y
```

## Running

Use the `run.sh` script to run all the solution in the current year or pass an
year as `$1` argument 

```
./run.sh
./run.sh 2015
```

> **Warning** 4.0 minimum bash version required
